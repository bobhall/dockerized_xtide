Icon News

XTide 2.14 (2014-11-02)

   See [3]Changelog for what's new and get it from
   [4]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#xtide.

libtcd 2.2.6-r2 (2014-10-25)

   Release 2 of libtcd 2.2.6 contains updated build support for Android,
   Visual Studio, and DOS.

Android and iOS ports

   [5]These ones are GPL.

New icons

   Another set of [6]improved icons for XTide has been contributed by
   Kelly Bellis.

tideEditor 1.4.3

   tideEditor has finally been migrated from Qt 3 to Qt 4.  Available from
   [7]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#extras.

   2012-10:  A person using Debian 6 had problems building tideEditor
   because the relative paths that Qt headers used to include one another
   had changed.  It was necessary to add -I/usr/include/qt4 to the list of
   qt4 directories in CPPFLAGS (see the README) to make it build.
   However, as of Slackware 14.0 and Qt 4.8.2, the example in the README
   still works for me.  Is this a Debian nonconformity?

End of maintenance for non-free data

   For [8]various reasons, I have ended maintenance of the non-free data
   set.  Anyone interested in generating new harmonic constants from
   published data can find information and a list of data sources [9]here.

Mailing list

   There is an announce-only mailing list to which I send notices of each
   update to XTide or the harmonics data.  You can subscribe or read the
   archives at
   [10]http://ten.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/xtide-announce.

   Please note:  If an announcement to you gets bounced by your mail
   server, you fall off the list.  Some long-time contributors have fallen
   off because, unbeknownst to them, their ISPs subscribed to a spam
   blackholing service that blackholed all pair.com-hosted domains after
   one of them sent out spam.

To do list

   XTide

   The XML parser should be bundled under the libxtide namespace but
   isn't.

   harmgen
     * Use liboctave instead of a script file or convert to R.
     * Add pointer to [11]help on installing Octave.

   libtcd

   Things to do in the next major revision, if there ever is one:
     * Add header field to flag tides versus currents.
     * Get rid of internal state; fix inability to have more than one
       database open.
     * Remove gratuitous complexity in the encoding of speeds, equilibrium
       arguments, and node factors; make speeds 32-bit unsigned with no
       offset.
     * Possibly permit node factors to be specified for intervals shorter
       than 1 year and/or support apps that use libcongen to generate the
       node factors themselves.
