  XTide 2.14 (libxtide.so.0.0.0) (2014-11-02)

   Moved all "common" files into a separate library and namespace,
   libxtide.  If libdstr is not provided the Dstr class gets included in
   libxtide.

   Enabled building libxtide, tide, and xttpd for Android:
     * Fixed configure.ac nit that blocked cross-compiling.
     * Added configure option --enable-lm_hard.
     * Added workaround for Android/Bionic quirk of failing on zoneinfo
       paths introduced by a colon character.  This fixes the time zones
       problem that affected MX Tides.
     * Added example script for cross-compiling libpng, libtcd, libxtide,
       tide, and xttpd for Android on x86 or x86_64 Linux in
       scripts/Android.

   Other portability and code rot:
     * Added new build script for Visual Studio.  The Cygwin dependency is
       removed at the cost of using a pre-generated configuration.  Zlib
       and libpng are now built automatically with no mucking about in the
       Visual Studio IDE.
     * Updated Makefile.dj2 for DJGPP 2.04 and to build libxtide.
     * Changed GCC minimum version test to ignore Clang, which
       fraudulently identifies itself as an old GCC.  Bug report credit:
       Ryan Schmidt.
     * Changed GCC minimum version failure into a big ugly warning.  Since
       initializer lists have become optional, some pre-4.4 versions work
       again.
     * Replaced a preprocessor test for Visual Studio with a more general
       configure-time check for whether std::vector has an
       initializer_list constructor.  This fixes the SafeVector build
       error on OS X Mountain Lion.  Mavericks was never afflicted.  Bug
       report credit:  Dan Hinckley.

   New settings:
     * XTide*caldayfmt (-cf) controls the format string used to print days
       in calendars.
     * XTide*linebreak (-lb) controls whether or not calendar mode inserts
       a line break before prediction values.  This reduces truncation in
       text format and tweaks line wrapping in HTML and LaTeX formats.
     * XTide*omitunits (-ou) prints numbers with no ft/m/kt and adds a
       header line stating the units and datum (where possible).
     * XTide*pagebreak (-pb) controls whether or not calendar mode inserts
       a page break and repeats the station header for each month in text,
       HTML, and LaTeX formats.  Text uses form feeds and HTML uses a
       page-break-before style.

   New, experimental configurable --enable-moon-age replaces the moon
   phase column of calendar mode with moon age.  This number wants to be
   replaced by graphics showing the moon as it would appear
   (approximately) on each day of the lunar month as originally suggested
   by Kelly Bellis, but it's not easy to implement that consistently
   across all formats.  FWIW, Unicode 1F311 through 1F318 provide
   characters for 8 phases of the moon that could be used in UTF-8 text
   modes.

   (Tweak) Centered calendar cell contents in HTML and text formats as
   they already were in LaTeX format.

   (Note) In most modes the approximately zero prediction values
   associated with slack water events are output, but they are omitted in
   calendar mode.  Noted but not changed.

   Thanks to Kelly Bellis for suggestions to improve calendar mode.

  XTide 2.13.2 (2013-07-21)

   (Bug) Fixed that a UTF-8 locale didn't make any difference to text form
   graph and clock mode output.

   (Portability) For DOS:
     * Updated bundled Dstr to version 1.0.
     * Added CP437 as a possible codeset value (requires Dstr 1.0).
     * Customized BROKEN_ZONEINFO error message for DJGPP.
     * If nl_langinfo isn't available, the hardcoded value for codeset can
       be selected at compile time by defining CODESET.
     * Added DJGPP makefile and suggested settings in scripts/DOS.

   (Feature) Made the default prediction interval configurable (new
   setting -pi replaces Global::defaultPredictInterval).

  XTide 2.13.1 (2013-07-10)

   (Code rot) libXaw3dXft 1.6.2b changed the name of the library and
   include path again.

   (Code rot) Disabled the ancient and obsolete zoneinfo compatibility
   hack for everything except Visual Studio because it masked time zone
   breakage in an Android port.

   (Portability) Removed requirement for the C++ compiler to support C++11
   extended initializer lists and got the Visual Studio build working
   again.

   (Removed limitation) Incorporated patch from James Ashton to replace
   the Skycal etcorr function, which was limiting moonrise/moonset
   predictions to years 1900 through 2099.

   Nit fixes:
     * Build scripts:  only the interactive client needs to link with
       libgps.  Tested with gpsd 3.9.
     * Per Kelly Bellis suggestion to expose version number through GUI:
       added "About XTide" to options menu; added version string at the
       top of the disclaimer text.
     * Added missing entry for Control Panel in help for options menus.
     * Documented that datefmt setting is ignored in calendar mode.

  XTide 2.13 (2012-06-03)

   (Misfeature) Mostly eliminated the need to set the resource
   XTide*beNiceToColormap: False to avoid ugly borders with Xaw3d and
   Xaw3dXft.  Added documented bug for the remaining case, which afflicts
   xxHorizDialog via libXaw3d's asciiTextWidgetClass and seems unfixable.

   (Nit) Deleted a superfluous configuration change for libXaw3dXft.

   (Nit) Fixed new (GCC 4.7.0) warnings in Date.cc, xxRoot.cc, and xxX.cc.

  XTide 2.13 RC3 (2012-03-04)

   (Code rot) libXaw3dXft took a hard left turn and jumped versions from
   1.3.3 to 1.6.2.  RC3 will correctly detect and use libXaw3dXft 1.6.2,
   but is no longer compatible with 1.3.3.  A tweak that fixes the problem
   with long menus in the Set Time dialog is enabled.

   Caution:  If using Xaw3d or Xaw3dXft, borders will be ugly unless you
   set the resource XTide*beNiceToColormap: False.

   (Compatibility) Added a workaround so that GCC 4.4 can build the
   complicated extended initializer list in Global.cc.

   (Tweak) If building with GCC 4.6 or above, use #pragma GCC diagnostic
   ... to quash nuisance warnings.

  XTide 2.13 RC2 (2012-02-25)

   (Nit) Configure:  Add CPPFLAGS for FreeType only when actually needed.

   (Cleanup) Removed unused field from ClientSide::Glyph.

   (Optimization) When creating ClientSide::Font, null out and skip
   characters 0-31 and 128-159.

  XTide 2.13 RC1 (2012-02-21)

   This release candidate of XTide requires compiler support for C++11
   extended initializer lists.  GCC has supported them since version 4.4.
   Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition doesn't have them, so the Visual C++
   build is on ice until something changes.

   (Feature) For Athena Widgets, configure will now look for Xaw3dXft (>=
   1.3.3), Xaw3d, or Xaw, in that order.  Plain Xaw can be forced using
   --disable-3d.  Thanks to Jean-Pierre Demailly for patches to make XTide
   work with Xaw3dXft (and vice-versa).
     * Xaw3d is a fork from an old version of Athena Widgets that offers
       improved scrollbars and a different look for buttons.  Its last
       release was version 1.5E in 2003.  Some issues that were
       subsequently fixed in Athena Widgets, such as long menus running
       off the screen, were fixed differently in Xaw3d.  (This affects the
       Set Time dialog, where the list of years to choose from can be
       quite long.)
     * Xaw3dXft is a fork from Xaw3d 1.5E that uses FreeType fonts.  The
       primary site is
       [4]http://sourceforge.net/projects/sf-xpaint/files/libxaw3dxft/.

   (Feature) GUI improvements:
     * Made location list and disclaimer windows resizable.
     * Fixed layout in location choosers.
     * Added keyboard handler to scrollable viewports.
     * Added -mf setting to select monospace font (interactive client
       only).*
     * Added -gf setting to select graph/clock font (interactive client
       only).*
     * Fixed text alignment in graphs again.
     * Changed embedded graph font to LiberationSans.
     * Set a maximum initial height on the control panel.

   * Important usage note:  If XTide is built with Xaw3dXft, font names
   given to XTide must be in fontconfig format (e.g., "Helvetica-10"),
   rather than the traditional XLFD (e.g.,
   "-*-helvetica-*-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*").  Also, Xaw3dXft does not
   return errors if there are problems with a font name; it just loads a
   default font instead.

   (Code rot) Added thousands of unholy casts to make the "warning:
   deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*'" nagging go away
   for all the places where I have to call library functions that don't
   use const.  Between that nagging and the new nagging about auto_ptr,
   the deprecation was getting thick in here.

   (Compatibility) Fixed problem with graph mode no longer working right
   on a VT100.  If TERM is set to vt100 or vt102 and text form is
   requested, the Special Graphics set will be used to get the middle dot
   and degree sign characters.  However, non-ASCII characters in location
   names and other data received from the TCD file will still do something
   weird.  Bug report credit:  John Andrews.

   (Feature) If TERM is set to vt100 or vt102 and text form is requested,
   depth lines in graphs will be aligned better using characters from the
   Special Graphics set.  (I don't have a VT100, but it looks right in
   xterm's emulation.)

   (Misfeature) Made HTML form of about mode less ugly.

   (Bug) Corrected inconsistent quantization of coordinates (inconsistent
   rounding of half-pixels) in the Graph hierarchy.

   (Compatibility) Added a cast to work around an ambiguous overload of
   waitpid (used in xttpd.cc) that appeared with GCC 4.5.3 and Cygwin.
   (Did not occur with GCC 4.6.2 under Linux.)

   (Code rot) Updated backward-compatible time zone mapping for Samoa.
   The entire hopeless workaround for obsolete zoneinfo should be killed
   with fire, but it is still invoked when tide is built with Visual C++.

  XTide 2.12.1 (2011-11-27)

   (Bug) Fixed missing encoding (character set) specification in SVG,
   which caused browser SVG rendering to fail when the station name
   contained interesting characters.  Bug report credit:  Keith N. Smith.

   (Portability) Updates to support building tide.exe using Visual C++
   2010 Express Edition:
     * Removed a use of snprintf.
     * Worked around the absence of a scanf format compatible with
       uint8_t.  The previous default of guessing "hhx" whenever SCNx8 was
       not properly defined led to memory corruption, as Visual C++ would
       treat the target variable as something larger than 1 byte.
     * Updated build procedure in documentation.

   (Nit) Updated CONFIGURE-HELP from autoconf's INSTALL.

  XTide 2.12 (2011-11-03)

   (Bug) Removed incorrect SVGGraph.cc dependency on X11 (thanks Jeff
   Dairiki).

  XTide 2.12 RC1 (2011-08-28)

   (Feature) Added support for the SVG format.  Thanks to Jack Greenbaum.
     * Command line client supports -fv.
     * Interactive client supports choice of format when saving clocks and
       graphs.
     * xttpd uses JavaScript to decide between SVG via the embed tag or
       PNG via the img tag.

   (Code rot) The nofill (-nf) setting was deprecated in favor of
   graphstyle (-gs), and the anti-alias (-aa) setting went away.

   (Feature) Added a fancier style of graph (generalized from Jack
   Greenbaum's SVG code, example possibly embedded below) as graphstyle s
   (semitransparent).  Set opacity with -to; set line width with -lw.
   Note that semitransparent style makes no sense in formats that don't
   support opacity (text and PseudoColor X-windows).

   JGFeatures SVG graph example

   (Speedup) On TrueColor displays, graphs and clocks are now drawn by
   constructing an RGBGraph and converting it to a Pixmap.  xxPixmapGraph
   (the Graph implementation that uses X11's drawing functions) is now
   used only on ye olde PseudoColor displays.  The excruciatingly bad and
   slow implementation of opacities in xxPixmapGraph has been deleted
   along with the crufty caching code that failed to speed it up.

   (Cleanup) Parameters in Graph and subclasses that were misleadingly
   named "saturation" changed to "opacity."

   (Tweak) Turned off interlacing for PNGs, since it always seemed to do
   more harm than good.

   (Code rot) Made XTide work with gpsd 3.x.  This is an incompatible
   change; gpsd 2.9x no longer works.

   (Notes) Browser support for SVG is still tricky.
     * Firefox 5
          + If an SVG is embedded using img, Firefox 5 uses jaggy scaling
            at some zoom levels.
          + Font scaling is inaccurate in the Linux version.
     * Internet Explorer 9
          + If <!DOCTYPE html> is not present at the start of a web page,
            Internet Explorer 9 pretends not to know what SVG is.
          + Embedding SVG using object is unreliable.  It worked in simple
            tests but failed when used by xttpd.
          + SVG embedding doesn't work for local files (IE behaves
            differently for the same HTML retrieved from a web server).
     * Other browsers were not tested, as there are enough problems
       already just getting the top two to work.

  XTide 2.11 (2010-08-11)

   Comment changes only.  The integration with gpsd 2.95 is still dubious
   after very limited testing, so it's just as well that XTide won't
   automatically link with gpsd 3.0 when that comes out.

  XTide 2.11 RC1 (2010-07-02)

   Patches from Trent Piepho:
     * (Feature) Allow use of -ml on xtide command line.
     * (Bug) Fixed memory leak (pixmap leak) in xxMap.
     * (Optimization) Replaced a sqrt with a multiply in xxMap and
       xxGlobe.

   Code changes inspired by patches from Trent Piepho, but more or less
   different than what was suggested:
     * (Feature) Added -tc and -cc settings to set the color of the dots
       indicating tide and current stations respectively in the location
       chooser.  (Both formerly used the mark color.)  This incurred a new
       bug:  The location chooser depends on a station naming convention
       to determine which stations are currents.  If that convention is
       not followed, dots may be drawn in the wrong color.
     * (Bug) Fixed WVS dir specified in xtide.conf not working with
       --enable-local-files.
     * (Bug) Fixed improper handling of widget internal margins in xxMap
       that was causing some flat map behaviors to be slightly off.
     * (Semi-bug) Corrected the overly conservative vertical scaling of
       graphs for stations that have a large number of constituents.  This
       involved changing the method used to estimate tidal range.  As a
       side-effect, stats mode no longer reports the absolute mathematical
       bounds; it instead reports the new "estimated" bounds, which are
       tighter but may occasionally be exceeded.
     * (Nits) Changed from truncation to rounding of translated
       coordinates in xxGlobe and xxMap to avoid the pile-up at zero that
       truncation produces.
     * (Nits) Added some consts, corrected some comments and help text in
       xxGlobe and xxMap.

   (Feature) Added -ch setting to specify clock height independently from
   graph height.

   (Feature) If gpsd 2.92 or a compatible 2.9x version is present and
   working, start the location chooser zoomed in on the current GPS fix.

   (Usability) Versions of GCC older than 3.4 are now unconditionally
   rejected by configure.

   (Usability) Reject attempts to regenerate the configure script using
   autoconf 2.65, which has a regression that causes the INT*_T tests to
   fail improperly.

   (Code rot) Fixed resize lag in the newer generation of window managers
   (including Metacity, Compiz, KWin, Xfwm, and Openbox) that deliver a
   firehose stream of resize events.  (The Xlib Programming Manual says
   the ConfigureNotify event is to be generated when the resize request
   "actually completes.")

   (Bug) In About mode, X-windows form, implemented line wrapping so that
   long descriptive text that is not formatted with linebreaks does not
   result in a ludicrously wide window.

   (Code rot) Compatibility with libpng 1.4:
     * Direct access to jmpbuf was deprecated.  Use the new macro instead.
     * png_check_sig was replaced by a macro, causing the autoconf test
       for linking with the library to fail.  Use png_sig_cmp instead.

   (Portability) Added workaround for [5]GCC Bug #43905 so that XTide can
   be compiled with GCC 4.5.0.

   (Cleanup) Purged leftover xOrigin/yOrigin complexity from xxGlobe.cc.

  XTide 2.10 (2008-02-05)

   (Code rot) Updated bundled Dstr to version 20080124.

   (Documentation) Fixed man page nits and related nits in documentation
   of command-line switches.

  XTide 2.10 RC1 (2008-01-18)

   (Feature) Enabled clock mode output (mode k) in PNG and text forms from
   the command-line client.  This feature was requested to enable the
   construction of embedded clock widgets.  (Suggested by Mark Crossley)

   (Portability) Fixed incorrect resolution of utsname on Suns.  Bug
   report credit:  C. Jeffery Small.

   (Code rot) Set the magic environment variable to opt out of the
   backward-incompatible changes made by the Composite extension to X11.
   Said changes were causing XTide windows to appear transparent in
   foo-foo windowing environments.  Bug report credit:  Alan E. Davis.

   (Documentation) Beefed up the man pages and made minor clarifications
   to the descriptions of some settings.

  XTide 2.9.5 (2007-12-10)

   (Portability) Renamed CONFIGURE to CONFIGURE-HELP to eliminate conflict
   on case-insensitive file systems.  Bug report credit:  Anton Pitts
   (Mac), Leonid Tochinski (Windows).

   (Portability) With help from Leonid Tochinski, made command-line client
   portable to Visual C++ Express Edition.
     * Tolerate missing header files and functions.
     * Use nonstandard header files if present.
     * Possibly use #pragma message instead of #warning.
     * #define _USE_MATH_DEFINES.
     * Specified binary mode for some files used by tide.exe.
     * Tolerate MS-DOS line discipline in xtide.conf.
     * Some Windows-specific code for low-level file operations.
     * In source files needed for tide.exe, renamed every variable named
       _timezone to timezoneLocalVar to eliminate conflict with global
       _timezone variable.
     * Fixed a yyerror signature mismatch between xml_l.ll and xml_y.yy.
     * Added --enable-semicolon-pathsep and --enable-local-files.
     * Possibly use %I strftime format instead of %l.
     * Only if compiling under Visual C++, set locale to "English_United
       States.1252".
     * Added a workaround for a time function bug in Visual C++ 2005 that
       causes the program to crash.

  XTide 2.9.4 (2007-09-03)

   (Bug) Fixed incorrect encoding of characters in "About This Station"
   window when ambient locale is UTF-8.

   (Legal) Relicensed under GPLv3.

   (Code rot) configure.ac:  Removed -DYY_NO_UNPUT, which flex no longer
   respects as of version 2.5.33.

   (Cleanup) Build scripts:  Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE and made 'make
   dist-bzip2' do the right thing.

  XTide 2.9.3 (2007-04-17)

   (Bug) Fixed dropped lines in flat map drawing (improved version of
   recent fix to tideEditor).

   (Portability) Moved #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS to the top of
   common.hh to avoid a surprise that occurs when inttypes.h gets included
   by a previous include file.

   (Cleanup) Removed an unused #define from common.hh.

  XTide 2.9.2 (2007-03-31)

   (Bug) In MLLW estimation, possibly include final LLW value depending on
   endTime.

   (Usability) Set year limits for time control dialogs based on the
   actual type of time_t rather than the conservative interval common to
   all platforms.

   (Usability) Made xttpd report version of XTide; removed obsolete
   discussion of PNG image format.

   (Usability) Catch missing STL at configure time (reportedly not found
   without CPPFLAGS under Mac OS X 10.4.9).

   (Portability) Fixed several nonportable casts in xxGlobe.cc (32-bit int
   assumption); replaced constant 8 with CHAR_BIT in two places.

   (Cleanup) A few more cleanups.
     * Cleaned up config.hh.  Most #defines were changed to typed
       constants.  Definitions not related to settings were moved to more
       appropriate locations.
     * Removed a few includes from common.hh.
     * Cleaned up format strings in Colors.cc.
     * Moved wvsrtv declaration to xxGlobal.hh.

  XTide 2.9.1 (2007-03-14)

   (Bug) Changed estimation of MLLW in stats mode to use tidal day as
   specified by [6]Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 1 and 2 instead of solar
   day as was done in XTide 2.9.  It makes about 1 inch of difference.

   (Compliance) GNU attributes are now enabled only if one configures with
   --enable-gnu-attributes.  They are only useful if compiling with extra
   warnings anyway.

   (Usability) Compilers that cannot build a particular test case
   correctly (notably GCC 3.3.x) are now rejected by configure with an
   explanation that it is time to upgrade.

  XTide 2.9 (2007-02-27)

   (Portability) Cygwin doesn't have llround yet.  Made do without it.

   (Compliance) Rearranged some callbacks to avoid the need for objects in
   the X11 interface to delete themselves (considered harmful) or their
   containers (presumably worse).

   (Cleanup) A few more cleanups.
     * Quashed default copy constructors and assignment operators on
       classes that did not want to have them.
     * Changed an unsigned char to a bool.
     * Made factories static members of the classes that they produce,
       thereby eliminating another friend function.
     * Tagged return values as const.  See coding conventions.
     * Cleaned up the templates.
     * Got rid of redundant declarations of friend functions.
     * Replaced a magic number with a constant.

  XTide 2.9 RC3 (2007-02-18)

   (Bug) Stopped time warps on subordinate stations from crashing
   calendars, AGAIN.  The parent class of the class that was junked and
   rewritten the last time around has been junked and rewritten.  Calendar
   mode has been reimplemented in an entirely different style at great
   expense and at the last minute.

   (Code rot) Fixed configure to detect and use libdstr if it is present.

   (Optimization) Inlined some functions and methods to make the
   highfalutin' C++ code in XTide 2.9 run as fast as the crufty C code in
   XTide 2.8.3.  See commentary in ConstituentSet::tideDerivative for
   details.

   (Usability) Decreased scrolling fraction for flat map from 95% to 25%
   (consistent with globe).  Made station dots bigger in globe (more like
   map).  Made tide graphs scroll by half the width of the graph instead
   of by 1 day.

   (Docs) Added makefile rule to generate README, ChangeLog, NEWS,
   AUTHORS, and README-QUICK from the web site.

  XTide 2.9 RC2 (2007-02-11)

   (Feature/Cleanup) Added estimation of MLLW to stats mode; made stats
   mode text from RC1 more consistent.

   (Usability) Improved error reporting to distinguish absence of an
   HFILE_PATH from absence of harmonics files.

   (Cleanup) The C++ standard does in fact promise that the elements of a
   std::vector are stored contiguously--purged MemoryChunk and replaced
   its uses with vectors.

   (Nits) Fixed a violation of coding conventions; improved commentary in
   several places.

  XTide 2.9 RC1 (2007-02-01)

   (Cleanup) 100% code review and major cleanup.
     * Performed numerous major and minor refactorings.
     * Replaced crufty data structures with standard templates.
     * Updated obsolescent coding practices.
     * Corrected improper inheritance relationships.
     * Purged dead, duplicate, and wasteful code.
     * Purged gratuitous complexity and excessive generality.
     * Purged speed hack that was incompatible with the design (hoping
       that nobody will be impacted by the performance hit).
     * Improved integrity checking.
     * Created enums for cryptic parameters.
     * Used const where applicable.
     * Defined coding conventions.

   (Code rot) Installed canonical Dstr.  Only visible impact should be
   different sorting of location names containing æ, ð, ø, ß, or
   fractions.

   (Code rot) Caused xttpd to serve /favicon.ico as expected by most
   browsers nowadays.

   (Code rot) Added support for the newfangled NET_WM protocol to set
   window titles.  This resolves an issue with window titles getting
   mangled when the ambient locale is UTF-8.  Bug report credit:  Lutz
   Mändle.

   (Code rot) Converted to automake; updated configure.ac per autoconf
   2.60.

   (Code rot) Removed Cygwin and Irix workarounds for incomplete strftime
   implementations.  Cygwin's was fixed.

   (Optimization) Added a pixel cache to mitigate a performance bottleneck
   that occurs while anti-aliasing X graphs in xxPixmapGraph.

   (Feature) Added LaTeX format for calendar mode and associated settings
   pagewidth, pageheight, and pagemargin.

   (Feature) Added eventmask setting, deprecated nosunmoon setting.
   Eventmask allows moon phase, sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset to
   be enabled or disabled individually, whereas nosunmoon only allowed
   them to be enabled or disabled as a group.

   (Feature) Text and HTML form output are now generated in UTF-8 if that
   is the ambient codeset.  Names specified in UTF-8 on the command line
   are now understood.

   (Feature) Text mode graphs and banners now show darkness (night time)
   in a manner analogous to PNG or X graphs.

   (Feature) Mouse wheel (mapped as Button4 and Button5) now works to
   scroll text prediction windows, location lists, the control panel, and
   the disclaimer.

   (Feature) Added mean of maxima and minima and CPU time to stats mode.

   (Feature) Made raw and medium rare modes accessible from xtide command
   line.

   (Feature) Added setting to control whether tide graphs are anti-aliased
   on true color displays.

   (Feature) Added setting to label tenths of units in graphs.

   (Feature) Resolved timestamp collision problem in graphs.  (1) Shift
   location of timestamps to avoid collisions when feasible.  (2) Improved
   logic for deciding when to use short descriptions.

   (Usability) When failing to load a font, report the name of the font
   that failed to load.  When swapping the begin and end times, inform the
   user.

   (Portability) Used new autoconf feature to obtain integer types with
   known sizes.  Used these types for TIME_WORKAROUND and Interval.

   (Compliance) Spun off libtcd into a separate tarball.

   (Security) Allow configuring user and group for xttpd and make xttpd
   exit if the uid/gid can't be set thusly.

   (Robustness) Trap and report overflow when adding an Interval to a
   Timestamp.

   (Robustness) Generalized Timestamp::tm2utc and eliminated the last use
   of libc's mktime.  Bad or out-of-range timestamps provided by the user
   should now reliably yield a relevant error message.

   (Robustness) Fixed bug in handling (ignoring) of ill-formed x-fields in
   TCD.

   (Robustness) Modified Graph to be more compatible with variable-width
   fonts, similar to patch contributed by Lee Ann Rucker.

   (Bug) Fixed assertion failure on changing preferred units of length in
   control panel while a current station is displayed.

   (Bug) Fixed xttpd neglecting to demangle %XX syntax in exact query
   URLs.  Bug report credit:  James K. Lowden.

   (Bug) Fixed window manager closing prediction windows while subordinate
   dialogs were open, which caused XTide to fail to terminate when the
   last window was closed.

   (Bug) Fixed failure to apply color settings to control panel scrollbar.

   (Bugs) Fixed identification of day transitions in rare and pathological
   cases.  Prior to the fix, it was possible for calendar to put events in
   the wrong day around the time of daylight savings time changes in
   exotic locales having interesting DST rules.

   (Bug) Fixed invalid simplification of current sub stations having slack
   offsets and level adds that resulted in the slack offsets being ignored
   for affected stations.

   (Bug) Stopped time warps on subordinate current stations from crashing
   calendars, again.  The offending logic is that responsible for figuring
   how many columns are needed.  Said logic has broken repeatedly.  This
   time I basically gave up on the whole approach and dumbed it down to
   something that hopefully won't break.

   (Bug) Fixed incorrect rounding of negative coordinates in graphs.  You
   could notice this in text graphs or banners where column zero sometimes
   collected an hour tick that should already have scrolled off into
   negativeland.

   (Nit) Remove assertion failure if knots^2 are specified as the units in
   a sub station record (levelAdd units are always knots anyway).

   (Nits) Minor changes in calendar mode text.

   (Nit) Fixed off-by-one-second bug in end boundary setting for xttpd
   calendars.

   (Nit) Handle whitespace in HFILE_PATH correctly.

   (Nit) In disclaimer, replaced facetious reference to continental drift
   with serious references to subsidence and uplift.

   (Nit) Fixed shifting horizontal alignment of text in X11 text modes.

   (Nit) When applying settings in the control panel, preserve marklevels
   and steps but reset aspect and units to defaults or whatever the new
   settings specify.

   (Nit) Instead of always barfing when HOME is unset, barf only when the
   need arises to write something to the home directory, and do without
   any config files that would normally be there.

   (Nit) Once again changed descriptive text related to the middle-level
   line to avoid confusion.

   (Nit) Fixed unintended scrolling of X11 text modes triggered in rare
   circumstances.

   (Nit) Fixed X11 graphs and clocks momentarily flashing to background
   color when updating.

   (Nit) Minor changes to short descriptions for tide events.

   (Bug) Added documented bug for xttpd logging timezone shift.

   (Bug) Added documented bug for control panel vanishing buttons problem.

   (Cosmetic) Installed new default icon.

  XTide 2.8.3 (2006-03-13)

   (Code rot) Made to compile under gcc 4.1.0.

  XTide 2.8.2 (2005-01-06)

   (Bug) Fixed "oops" in xxMap.cc that caused station dots to be
   suppressed on part of the flat map.  Bug report credit:  Jan Depner.

  XTide 2.8.1 (2004-12-28)

   (Portability) Updated configure to look in lib64 for X libs, for
   compatibility with x86_64.  Bug report credit:  Fedora / David Kaplan.

  XTide 2.8 (2004-12-10)

   (Nit) More intelligent selection of WVS resolutions in globe.  The
   wvs3.dat file now gets use.

   (Nit) Don't suppress single-point islands on globe.

  XTide 2.8 BETA 2 (2004-11-17)

   (Bug) Tried to fix crash on startup on multi-head displays (no feedback
   on whether it worked).

   (Oversight) Omitted slack offsets are now handled by interpolating from
   known tide events rather than defaulting to reasonable values.  This
   should have been done as part of the changes in Beta 1.

  XTide 2.8 BETA 1 (2004-10-26)

   (Bug) The subordinate station interpolation algorithm derived from work
   by Jean-Pierre LaPointe started misbehaving when it met the new NOS
   data imported 2004-09.  See Exhibit A.

   Exhibit A: discontinuous tide graph for Hana, Maui

   That algorithm was designed around architectural problems that were
   eliminated in the refactorings of XTide 2.7.  Replaced it with a
   simpler and better algorithm that solves the above problem and three
   others (appearing below).

   The old algorithm had the interesting property that, as a side effect
   of fudging around pathological cases that broke the algorithm, the
   graph would often be a more likely model of reality than unquestioning
   loyalty to the corrections would give.  No such luck with the new
   algorithm, unless I deliberately break it in the same way.  See Exhibit
   B, where an application of offsets to the insignificant higher low and
   lower high tides at Kahului has produced a significant (and probably
   mythical) tide cycle at Hana on the evening of 2004-09-08.

   Exhibit B: Kahului
   Exhibit B: Hana ho

   (Bug) Fixed this longstanding documented bug:

     Tide graphs and raw output for subordinate current stations won't
     mesh with the predicted times of slack water, Min Flood or Min Ebb.
     Cause of bug: The interpolation algorithm used to produce tide
     graphs for subordinate stations doesn't do slack water.  Workaround:
     none.

   (Bug) Removed this longstanding documented limitation:

     The raw tide levels for subordinate current locations whose
     reference stations are hydraulic will do bogus things for a few
     minutes around the time of slack water.  Hydraulic currents
     exacerbate a minor inaccuracy that exists for all subordinate
     stations, producing a major inaccuracy.

   (Feature) Removed this longstanding documented limitation:

     For most subordinate stations, you can't set a mark level.

   (Bug?) Changed application of offsets for Min Flood and Min Ebb on
   subordinate current stations to match what I think is NOS' intent.  For
   details, see [7]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/mincurrents.html.

   (Bug) Fixed an IMPOSSIBLE_CONVERSION failure (oddly enough, from some
   units to the same units) triggered by opening a station, converting
   units, setting a mark level, and then opening a new window from the
   Options menu.  Kudos to August Hahn for discovering the steps to
   reproduce this "interesting" bug.  Added a new warning, NO_CONVERSION,
   to flag any other occurrences of the same thing.

   (Code rot) Added :America/Juneau, :America/Nome, :America/Yakutat and
   :Pacific/Johnston to the compatibility table for platforms with
   obsolete zoneinfo.  (Deliver me from Solaris 8!)

   (Bugs & Features) Upgraded to libtcd 2.0.

   (Feature) Added about mode.  (As in "About this station")

   (Cleanup) Cleaned up strange coding in StationRef, HarmonicsFile, and
   Offsets left over from the days of XML sub stations.

   (Cleanup) Deleted some dead pretty-printing code in Speed, Constituent,
   etc.; got rid of static buffers in some other pretty-printing code; got
   rid of the Constituent class (merged into TabulatedConstituent); synced
   Angle::normalize with fp roundoff fix and assertion from Congen; added
   an assertion that node factors should be greater than 0 (this will
   detect TCD files with overflow problems).

   (Cleanup) Removed CFLAGS from the build process; just use CXXFLAGS.
   Removed -DNVSUNOS from configure.in since it has no effect on libtcd.

   (Cleanup) Moved libtcd accesses out of TabulatedConstituent.  Moved
   libtcd dependencies out of HarmonicsFile.hh and changed build
   dependencies so that only HarmonicsFile gets rebuilt when libtcd is
   changed.

   (Bug) Changed "Mean Tide Level" verbiage (formerly "Mean Sea Level") to
   say "Mean Astronomical Tide."  The National Ocean Service (NOS) defines
   both Mean Sea Level (MSL) and Mean Tide Level (MTL) in terms of
   averages taken over observations.  The line drawn by XTide corresponds
   to the mathematical mean level of the predictions, which approximates
   both MSL and MTL, but, strictly speaking, is equivalent to neither.

   (Nits) Fixed nits revealed by g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic.

   (Bug) Fixed a logic error that could cause XTide to lock up if you
   looked at a period of more than 24 hours with no tide events in just a
   certain way.

   (Feature) Made the globe location chooser able to zoom in closer.

   (Nit) In both location choosers, quit chopping lines that are only
   partly outside the window.

  XTide 2.7.1 (2004-08-17)

   (Bugs) Incorporated libtcd patch:

     Version 1.13
     David Flater
     2004-08-15

     (create_tide_db)  Write a valid end_of_file record even if someone
     creates a database with no tide records.

     (tide_db_default)  Removed a superfluous space character in table of
     default datum types (after Lowest Astronomical Tide).

   (Evil) Disabled the translation of the TCD comments field into a notes
   field for sub stations.  It was a historical oddity that sub stations
   had notes but not comments and reference stations had comments but not
   notes, and this was no excuse for overloading the comments field.
   Harmbase2 now wants to put stuff in the comments field for sub
   stations, with the result that XTide 2.7 blabbers the comments to every
   user as a cryptic and strangely verbose note.  Notes will come back if
   and when the TCD format is extended to include a separate notes field.

  XTide 2.7 (2004-08-09)

   (Nit) Fixed xttpd to include the file name as well as the revision date
   when citing what version of which harmonics file it's using.

  XTide 2.7 BETA 2 (2004-07-01)

   (Portability) Ignore all hidden files (dot files) in a directory
   indicated by HFILE_PATH, not just "." and "..".  (OS X creates hidden
   files everywhere.)

   (Portability) Run ranlib on libtcd.a; ignore error if ranlib isn't
   there.  (OS X needs ranlib.)

   (Portability) Changed normalcflags and normalcxxflags in configure.in
   to say -O instead of -O2.  (Forte doesn't grok -O2.)

   (Portability) When looking for X11 in configure, recognize libXaw.dll.a
   (per latest Cygwin) as well as libXaw.so and libXaw.a.

   (Nit) Removed unnecessary escaping and quoting in a warning message in
   configure.in.

  XTide 2.7 BETA 1 (2004-04-20)

   (Code rot) libtcd 1.12:  Deleted #include <malloc.h> from tcd.h.

   (Nit) Replaced inappropriate radiation symbols in error windows with
   standard international symbols for general panic and impending doom.

   (Feature) Added iCalendar format and option to get iCalendar output
   from xttpd.

   (Feature) Added cbuttons setting to control whether clock windows
   appear with buttons by default.

   (Feature) Allowed setting location of lone window with -geometry.

   (Feature) Allowed specifying an IP address for xttpd.

   (Feature) Added CSV format to various modes.

   (Portability) Added test for Fedora RPM build environment in
   configure.  If found, usual and customary compiler and linker switches
   are suppressed and RPM_OPT_FLAGS are added.

   (Bug) Fixed small memory leak in SubordinateStation.cc.

   (Cleanup) Major refactoring of tide events handling code.
     * Original design:  predictExactTideEvent took an "internal"
       timestamp, scanned for tide events, returned a tide event with
       "corrected" timestamp (incorporating subordinate station
       corrections) and also the "uncorrected" timestamp from where
       scanning for the next event would continue.  Complex caching logic
       was needed to integrate actual tide-tide events with sun and moon
       events and still return events in the right order... usually.
       However, sub station corrections could still cause events to be
       returned out of order, and there was no way to fix it.
     * What happened:  Eventually every relevant module except xxTextMode
       grew its own crufty layer of linked list bashing to post-process
       the predictions, really get them in the right order, and meet other
       requirements unique to each module.  Circa version 2.6 the cruft
       achieved critical mass and began to obstruct routine maintenance.
     * The fix:  Linked list bashing made redundant by
       TideEventsOrganizer, which inherits standard multimap template.
       predictExactTideEvent replaced by predictExactTideEvents, which
       takes a range of timestamps and populates an organizer with exactly
       the events falling within that range (no "internal" timestamps
       required).  extendRange adds more events at the beginning or end of
       an organizer to support scrolling types of behaviors, albeit in
       chunks instead of single events.
     * Outcome:  Cruft greatly reduced.  Several previously unfixable bugs
       were fixed (see below).  -b and -e ranges now mean something.
       Scrolling performance in xxTextMode slightly degraded.

   (Bug) Fixed this longstanding documented bug:

     There are edge effects at the start and end of an interval chosen
     for subordinate station predictions.  Some events that are inside of
     the interval may be excluded, and vice-versa.  Cause of bug: While
     the interval is faithfully scanned for the reference station, tide
     events can jump in or out of the chosen interval after the offsets
     are applied.  Workaround: Leave a margin around the interval of
     interest that is larger than the offsets of the subordinate station
     (a few hours should suffice).

   (Bug) Fixed this longstanding documented bug:

     If two events (e.g., high tide and full moon) happen to coincide
     very closely, within 1 minute of each other, and you reverse the
     direction of the scrolling in the interactive plain mode window at a
     point where only one of the events is visible, you might be able to
     make the other one disappear.  Cause of bug: accuracy of
     predictions, precision of timestamps.  Workaround: don't do that.

   (Bug) Fixed this longstanding documented bug:

     In the interactive plain mode window only, tide events can be listed
     out of order for subordinate stations.  Cause of bug: design
     conflict.  Efficient scrolling is incompatible with keeping the list
     sorted.  Workaround: save the predictions to a file and they will be
     sorted.

   (Nit) -b and -e ranges now mean specifically "all t such that b <= t <
   e."

   (Nit) Expunged anachronistic references to "text mode" (it's plain
   mode).

   (Bug) Fixed an assertion failure "tidecol < numcol" that could occur
   generating calendars for pathological subordinate current stations
   where applying the offsets causes slack-before-flood to happen after
   max flood or analogous for ebb.

   (Nits) Added casts and changed data types to get rid of
   unsigned-to-signed comparison warnings.

   (Cleanup) Major refactoring of settings management code to fix this
   longstanding "known design problem:"

     Nine source files must be changed to add one new setting
     (Settings.hh, Settings.cc in 3 places, config.hh, UserDefaults.cc,
     xxApplicationDefaults.cc, ConfigDefaults.cc, CommandLineSettings.cc
     in 2 places, xxXTideRoot.cc in 4 places, and xxXTideRoot.hh).

  XTide 2.6.4 (2003-11-16)

   (Bugs) Incorporated libtcd patch:

     Version 1.11
     David Flater
     2003-11-16

     (create_tide_db)  Fixed horrible bug:  offsets for speeds,
     equilibrium args, and node factors were sign-reversed with respect
     to their usage in read_tide_db_header and write_tide_db_header,
     resulting in possible overflows.

     (read_tide_db_header)  Added handling for zero tide records, which
     happens on new database create.

     (open_tide_db)  Added check of modified flag to 2003-10-14 code.

     (close_tide_db)  Deleted repeat free of tindex introduced
     2003-10-14.  Cleared modified flag on close.

  XTide 2.6.3 (2003-10-14)

   (Bug) Incorporated libtcd patch:

     Version 1.10
     David Flater
     2003-10-14

     Incorporated patch from Phil Thornton that closes a memory leak and
     improves performance on repeat calls to open_tide_db.  See
     [8]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/tcd_notes.html

   (Nit) Added a precompiler directive to prevent code inside of assert
   statements from being disabled by over-ambitious optimization.

  XTide 2.6.2 (2003-09-05)

   (Bug) Incorporated libtcd patch:
    Version 1.09
    Jan C. Depner
    2003-09-04

    Bug fix - modifying last record in file and changing size of record caused
    a big problem.

  XTide 2.6.1 (2003-07-23)

   (Bug) Incorporated libtcd patch:
    Version 1.08
    Jan C. Depner
    2003-07-23

    Bug fix - deleting last record in file caused a big problem.

  XTide 2.6 (2003-05-28)

   No code changes; just promoted to final release status.

  XTide 2.6 BETA 4 (2003-03-27)

   (Nit) Updated version string in libtcd.

  XTide 2.6 BETA 3 (2003-03-27)

   (Bug) There was another problem with the encoding of subordinate
   stations in TCD files.  The only stations materially affected this time
   were Gnat Cove, Carroll Inlet, Alaska, and Olga Point, Olga Strait,
   Sitka Sound, Alaska.  However, the fix required another incompatible
   change to the encoding of subordinate stations and updates to affected
   code in libtcd and XTide.  TCD files produced with tcd-utils dated
   earlier than 2003-03-27 and previous development or beta versions of
   XTide 2.6 should be replaced to avoid getting incorrect results.

  XTide 2.6 BETA 2 (2003-03-18)

   (Bugs!) tcd-utils was building some subordinate current stations
   incorrectly.  The fix required an incompatible change to the encoding
   of slack offsets and updates to affected code in libtcd and XTide.  TCD
   files produced with tcd-utils dated earlier than 2003-03-18 and
   previous development or beta versions of XTide 2.6 should be replaced
   to avoid getting incorrect results on subordinate current stations.
   Except... ironically, it appears that some of the subordinate current
   stations presently in the database are broken in precisely the same way
   as one of the TCD bugs, with the result that in those cases, you get
   the right answer only with the broken code.  The issue with those is
   the bogus assumption that the right thing to do if you don't get slack
   offsets is set them to zero.  If you don't get slack offsets
   (floodbegins, ebbbegins), OMIT those fields!  When slack offsets are
   omitted, XTide will interpolate a reasonable value.  But if you specify
   zero, you get zero -- even if that's unreasonable given the skew of max
   and min.  (This note has been added to the relevant portion of the
   documentation.)

  XTide 2.6 BETA 1 (2003-02-20)

   (Optimization) Changed from ASCII format harmonics files (harmonics.txt
   and offsets.xml) to binary TCD format (harmonics.tcd); retired the
   problematic fast loader since all loading now occurs at ludicrous
   speed.  Thanks again to Jan Depner.

   (Feature) Added setting to enable inferred constituents (Jan Depner).

   (Code rot) Expunged all uses of deprecated C++ streams from the code
   except for the verbose debugging code that hasn't been used in ages.

   (Feature) Added support for the following command line syntactic
   shortcuts:
     * Arguments can be concatenated with their switches.
     * A yes/no switch that omits its argument implies "y".
     * Using +xx instead of -xx for a yes/no switch inverts the argument
       (so if the argument is omitted, "n" is implied).

   (Feature) Overhauled usage of time_t to allow timestamps to range
   before 1970 and after 2037.  Added TIME_WORKAROUND to enable access to
   the past and future years on platforms where time_t is 32 bits.

   (Portability) Changed default time formats when compiling under Irix to
   work around lack of support for %l in SGI's strftime implementation.
   C.f., similar Cygwin bug fixed in XTide 2.5 BETA 1 (2002-05-21) and the
   "fix" that started it all in XTide 2.4 BETA 1 (2001-03-25).  What a
   pain.

   (Nits) Gave the control panel a scrollbar.  Stabilized the layouts of
   the control panel, text, raw, and medium rare modes.  Merged
   xxRareModes into xxTextMode.

   (Feature) Replaced the now mostly useless filename field in location
   lists with a type field (reference or subordinate).

   (Feature) The zone at the bottom of tide graphs previously used to note
   slack and mark crossing events is now shared by moon events.  The date
   was replaced with a description that is abbreviated when things get
   crowded.

   (Feature) Added moonrise, moonset.

  XTide 2.5 (2002-07-14)

   (Nit) Tweaked some verbiage in the control panel.

  XTide 2.5 BETA 1 (2002-05-21)

   (Portability) Tweaked autoconfig files to allow clean compilation under
   OS X.  Thanks to Martin Hofmann.

   (Portability) Changed default time formats when compiling under Cygwin
   to work around lack of support for %l and %Z formats by Cygwin's
   strftime implementation.

   (Feature) Added medium rare mode.

   (Feature) Made raw and medium rare modes accessible from the GUI.

   (Feature) Incorporated new globe code, which added coastlines and a new
   flat map projection, from Jan C. Depner.

   (Feature) Allowed switching between Cylindrical Equidistant and
   Orthographic Projections.  Added setting to specify user's preference
   (flatearth).

   (Feature) Globe now rotates on two axes, and both globe and map include
   latitude and longitude readouts.

   (Feature/Portability) Incorporated patch from John Holden to improve
   xttpd user interface for requesting tide calendars and to work around
   an Alpha-specific bug in timestamp rendering.

   (Code rot) Updated :America/Iqaluit, :America/Mexico_City, and
   :Mexico/General in time zone compatibility table.

   (Bug) "Mean Sea Level" verbiage corrected to say "Mean Tide Level."
   Identifiers containing msl were not renamed.

   (Nit) Updated disclaimer text.

   (Nit) Cleaned up xxTimestamp.  N.B., newer versions of Athena Widgets
   now show two columns of choices where pull-down buttons used to run off
   the screen, so the "tiny font" previously used for some of the choices
   is no longer used here.  It is still used in the clock icon.

   (Nit) Added a line to the 'install' target of Makefile.in to create the
   target directories if they do not exist.

  XTide 2.4 (2001-05-09)

   (Bug) Fixed an OLD memory management bug in Dstr.cc.  Thanks to Phil
   Thornton.

  XTide 2.4 BETA 2 (2001-04-15)

   (Bug) xttpd did not supply a robots.txt page.  Added robots.txt patch
   from John Stanley.

  XTide 2.4 BETA 1 (2001-03-25)

   (Feature) Enhanced HFILE_PATH to enable searching of directories.

   (Bug) Removed, or at least improved, a kludge in Timestamp that was
   preventing 24-hour time users from getting leading zeros on hours.  A
   compensatory change to the default time and hour formats was also made.

   (Nit) Updated example in NO_HFILE_PATH error message again.

   (Tuning) Reduced fastload limit to 2.

   (Feature) Xttpd now shows the versions of the harmonics files that it's
   using on its main page.

   (Feature) Added a note attribute to subordinate station XML.

   (Optimization) Incorporated patch to squeeze out null constituents.

  XTide 2.3 (2000-12-08)

   No code changes; just promoted to final release status.

  XTide 2.3 BETA 2 (2000-10-01)

   (Code rot) Added :America/Belem, :America/Fortaleza, and
   :America/Maceio and revised abbreviation for :America/Sao_Paulo in time
   zone compatibility table.

   (Compliance) Smashed case in all (I hope) HTML markup tags for XHTML
   compatibility (sugg. Richard Kennedy).

   (Nit) Typographical tweaks in xttpd.

  XTide 2.3 BETA 1 (2000-09-03)

   (Feature) Replaced calendar mode with a clone of the much more popular
   one that Dean Pentcheff has been using on his web site.  The "old"
   calendar mode is still available from tide as -m C.

   (Feature) Added setting to suppress sunrise, sunset, moon phases.

   (Code rot) Added :America/Goose_Bay to timezone compatibility table.

   (Nit) Updated example in NO_HFILE_PATH error message.

  XTide 2.2.2 (2000-07-30)

   (Compliance) To comply with XML 1.0, the offsets.xml file was changed
   to have a single "root" document element.  As a result, XTide 2.2.1 and
   earlier cannot find the stations in it.  This patch enables XTide to
   read either old or new offsets.xml files.  The prolog of .xtide.xml
   written by XTide is also made compliant.

  XTide 2.2.1 (2000-07-16)

   (Code rot) Added :America/Hermosillo and :America/Iqaluit to the
   zoneinfo compatibility table.

  XTide 2.2 (2000-01-12)

   No code changes; just promoted to final release status.

  XTide 2.2 BETA 1 (1999-12-12)

   (Compliance) Xttpd now backgrounds itself and logs to the syslog
   facility.

   (Feature) Added /etc/xtide.conf as alternative to setting HFILE_PATH.
   The format of this should probably be XML to guard against future
   expansion, but for now it is as contributed from Debian (Peter
   Galbraith).

   (Feature) Ditched Imake for Autoconf, which simplifies installation.

   (Feature) Installed a Unicode-esque collating sequence for Latin1.

   (Feature) xttpd: applied location lookup patch from John Holden.  This
   enables URLs of the form http://whatever/locations/name in addition to
   the more reliable http://whatever/locations/nnn.html syntax.  The
   name-based URLs are not promulgated by xttpd itself.  The new syntax is
   documented in a new hints & tricks page served by xttpd.

   (Feature) If you set the environment variable XTIDE_DEFAULT_LOCATION,
   it works like the default location feature of XTide 1.

   (Robustness) Improved resolution of reference stations for subordinate
   stations to eliminate many SUB_SUBORDINATE errors.  Fast loading is
   still sensitive to the ordering of HFILE_PATH.

   (Code rot) Added an autoconf step to deal with mutually incompatible
   requirements of different platforms on the signature of the accept()
   function as used in xttpd.cc.

   (Code rot) Added Antarctic time zones to the compatibility table in
   Timestamp.cc.

   (Compliance) Changed packaging from xtide2/* every time to
   xtide-X.Y.Z/*.  Changed suggested disposition of xttpd from bin to
   sbin.  Changed xttpd man page section from 1 to 8.  Changed suggested
   disposition of harmonics files from /etc to /usr/local/share/xtide.

   (Compliance) Moved some static functions into externC.cc with
   appropriate signature changes to placate the Sun compiler's anachronism
   checker.

   (Portability) Added workaround for bug in Sun WorkShop Compiler C++
   SPARC Version 5.000.  Thanks to Raphael Malyankar.

   (Nit) Applied patch from Peter Galbraith to set background color in
   xttpd to white.

  XTide 2.1.7 (1999-08-14)

   (Bug) Fixed drawing of Latin1 characters.  This involved increasing the
   font height by one row, which will cause minor but noticeable changes
   in the placement of text.

   (Portability) Changed backlog parameter for socket in xttpd.cc from 0
   to 5.  Digital Unix would accept no connections if backlog was 0.
   Thanks to Giuseppe Cabras.

  XTide 2.1.6 (1999-08-09)

   (Bug) Fixed xttpd assertion failure when subordinate stations don't
   supply time zones.

   (Bug) Made RGBGraph stop crashing when it's asked to draw characters
   that it doesn't know.  To do, teach RGBGraph to draw the entire Latin1
   character set.

   (Portability) Messed with usage of select() in xttpd.cc to try to make
   it more portable.  Giuseppe Cabras reported trouble with it under
   Digital Unix.

   (Portability) Added Imakefile.hp from Christopher Caldwell.

  XTide 2.1.5 (1999-07-22)

   (Portability) Cleaned up overloading ambiguities and ANSI compliance
   problems encountered with HP aC++ B3910B A.01.18 (HP-UX 10.20).  Thanks
   to Christopher Caldwell.

  XTide 2.1.4 (1999-05-17)

   (Portability) Got rid of some dubious implicit conversions between
   PredictionValue::Unit and its encapsulated enum.  Don't know if they
   were strictly conforming or not, but they made the latest Sun compiler
   use the wrong constructor.  This showed up as UNRECOGNIZED_UNITS errors
   when trying to load a tide station.

  XTide 2.1.3 (1999-05-16)

   (Code rot) Stopped including stream.h in common.hh.  It was always
   redundant with iostream.h, but now stream.h has vanished from Sun's
   latest compiler.

  XTide 2.1.2 (1999-03-15)

   Add support for color specifications having the deprecated #RRGGBB
   format, which recently resurfaced on Debian.

   Patch from Falk Hueffner for Timestamp::tm2utc.  On his Alpha (BSD?),
   time_t is 64 bits but gmtime returns NULL if the time_t is out of a
   certain range, which was leading to segfaults.

   Fixed reporting of MKTIME_FAILED errors caused by bad timestamps on the
   -b and -e switches.

  XTide 2.1.1 (1999-01-24)

   Patch to get rid of all of the references to universe.digex.net that
   appeared in the sources and documentation.  No functional changes.

  XTide 2.1 (1998-12-20)

   Implemented something similar to a patch sent by Thomas Dean to enable
   the direction of current that he provided in his XML offsets to be
   displayed in the boilerplate of text output.  Making it work for
   reference stations is deferred until whenever reference stations are
   migrated to XML and the new attributes can conveniently be added.

   Removed $(DEPXPMLIB) from xtide dependencies (DEPLIBS1 in manifest) to
   get rid of this needless compilation failure:

make: *** No rule to make target `/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a', needed by `xtide'.
Stop.

   The cause of this was that some Linux distributions only provide a
   shared libXpm, while the dependencies generated by Imake check for the
   existence of the static library.

   Made -o switch append instead of overwrite files per request from AED.

  XTide 2.0.1 (1998-10-04)

   Fixed a bug reported by Alan Davis which caused access violations and
   other problems when a default center longitude was set in the control
   panel.

  XTide 2.0 (1998-07-28)

   No code changes; just promoted to final release status.

  XTide 2.0 Beta.3 (1998-06-28)

   Reversed order of location list latitude sort so that points north
   appear at the top (sug. Dave Davey).

  XTide 2.0 Beta.2 (1998-06-02)

   SGI portability fix from David Warren:  changed declarations of nested
   structs in header files to use Classname::structname instead of struct
   structname.

  XTide 2.0 Beta.1 (1998-06-01)

   First versioned release of XTide 2.
